                <p class="lead justify-text">I am Jan Patrick Echano, 24 years old, with a strong background in
                    information
                    technology and software development. I started my professional journey as an IT Support specialist,
                    where I provided technical assistance to teachers and employees, troubleshooting hardware and
                    software issues to ensure smooth daily operations. In this role, I was also responsible for managing
                    the computer laboratory, including system maintenance, network setup, software installation, and
                    ensuring that all equipment was fully functional and secure.
                    <br><br>
                    Building on this foundation, I transitioned into my current role as a Full Stack Developer. In this
                    position, I develop and maintain complete web-based systems, working on both front-end and back-end
                    components to deliver efficient, user-friendly, and scalable applications.

                    I am involved in database
                    design, API integration, system optimization, and continuous improvement of existing platforms.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to my development work, I serve as a part-time Robotics Instructor. In this
                    role, I teach fundamental programming concepts, electronics, and robotics principles, while guiding
                    students through hands-on projects that encourage problem-solving, critical thinking, and
                    innovation. This experience allows me to combine my technical expertise with teaching, mentorship,
                    and communication skills.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, my career reflects a continuous commitment to learning, adaptability, and applying
                    technology to solve real-world problems, both in professional environments and educational settings.
